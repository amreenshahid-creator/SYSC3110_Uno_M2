**Breakdown of Project Tasks and Responsibilities:**

Marc Aoun

For the past milestone, Marc implemented the core game flow, including player initialization for 2–4 players, displaying each player’s hand, validating card placement, and handling pass-turn functionality with drawing cards.
For the current milestone, Marc prepared the README, added JavaDocs, comments and completed the UML class diagram and the sequence diagrams.

Iman Elabd

For the previous milestone, Iman was responsible for JUnit testing across classes and methods, ensuring the game ran smoothly, finding bugs, and assisting team members when needed.
For the current milestone, Iman continued contributing to general code quality by improving synchronization between components, refining error handling, and expanding JUnit test coverage for model behavior and game logic.

Naima Mamun

In the past milestone, Naima focused on UML modeling and data structures, creating class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and documenting the structure and design decisions. She also prepared project documentation, the README, and JavaDocs.
For the current milestone, Naima worked on the graphical interface by implementing the JFrame, enabling 2–4 player selection, displaying player hands and the top card, and making the UI clear, organized, and responsive to user interaction.

Amreen Shahid

For the earlier milestone, Amreen implemented all UNO action card logic, including Draw One, Reverse, Skip, Wild, and Wild Draw Two. She also handled keyboard card placement and added scoring features.
For the current milestone, Amreen focused on the MVC structure, applying the Java event model, maintaining separation of concerns, and ensuring proper communication between the model, view, and controller.

**Breakdown of other deliverables:**
Our project follows four milestones: a text-based Uno game (Milestone 1),
a full GUI version with Model tests (Milestone 2),
Uno Flip and AI players with all tests passing (Milestone 3), 
and undo/redo plus save/load features (Milestone 4). 

Each milestone requires updated code, tests, UML diagrams, documentation, and a README describing changes, known issues, and team contributions. All work is packaged and submitted together in a single zip file for each iteration.

**Known issues:**
All features work as expected, and we did not encounter any known issues for this milestone.
